Project goal: to create an NFL statistical database to be used by anyone to quickly show common and advanced metrics for the NFL as a whole

This project first started after an argurment with the other players in a fantasy football group chat. I want to provide this data to potentialy save time for anyone in the future.

I will include any changes to the data as well so that all versions are available. If you have an idea to make the project any better then please let me know. I want this project to be as adapatable as possible.
